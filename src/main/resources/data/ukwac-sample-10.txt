Lower Charles Street, Southern Road and Park Street - Access Only        Based on a design proposal made in the late 1950s by staff members of the then Loughborough Training College and a panel of Instructors and Organisers the 5.125 x 14 Raglan training lathe utilised the same bed section, saddle, apron (less the screwcutting mechanism) tailstock and compound-slide assembly (though unfortunately with different feed screws and nuts) as the company's well-established Little John model.
The 1.031 bore (7/8 capacity) No. 3 Morse taper spindle ran in Timken taper roller bearings and was driven by a 1/2 hp single or 3-phase motor (externally-mounted beneath the headstock) through a 3-step flat belt pulley that gave speeds of 125, 350 and 600 rpm.
As an option (though rarely fitted) a 2-speed 3-phase motor was also available that gave a much more useful range of: 125, 250, 350, 600, 700 and 1200 rpm.
Like the Little John and later 5-inch models it was a very rigid lathe with the headstock and bed cast as one; unfortunately its limited speed range, and hand-feed-only design, mean that it is unsuitable for all but the simplest of model and experimental-engineering work.
Although intended as an inexpensive training lathe it was, like all other Raglan products, was sold at a premium price; in 1965 for example it was listed at � 119: 10: 0d., a sum only a little less than the � 128: 8: 0d asked for a backgeared and screwcutting Myford ML7 fitted out to the same specification with motor, switch gear, stand and chip tray.
